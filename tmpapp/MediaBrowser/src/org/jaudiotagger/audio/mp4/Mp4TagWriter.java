/**
 * Writes metadata from mp4, the metadata tags are held under the ilst atom as shown below
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * When writing changes the size of all the atoms upto ilst has to be recalculated, then if the size of
 * the metadata is increased the size of the free atom (below meta) should be reduced accordingly or vice versa.
 * If the size of the metadata has increased by more than the size of the free atom then the size of meta, udta
 * and moov should be recalculated and the top level free atom reduced accordingly
 * If there is not enough space even if using both of the free atoms, then the mdat atom has to be shifted down
 * accordingly to make space, and the stco atom has to have its offsets to mdat chunks table adjusted accordingly.
 *
 * Exceptions are that the meta/udta/ilst do not currently exist, in which udta/meta/ilst are created. Note it is valid
 * to have meta/ilst without udta but this is less common so we always try to write files according to the Apple/iTunes
 * specification. *
